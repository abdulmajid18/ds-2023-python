class Solution:
    """
    This solution finds the first and last occurrence of a target value in a sorted array using binary search.

    **Approach:**
    - Since the array is sorted, we can leverage **binary search** instead of a linear scan (O(n)), achieving O(log n) complexity.
    - We implement two separate binary search functions:
      1. `find_first(nums, target)`: Finds the **first occurrence** of `target`.
      2. `find_last(nums, target)`: Finds the **last occurrence** of `target`.

    **Binary Search Explanation:**
    - **Finding the first occurrence:**
      - Perform binary search and **store the index when `nums[mid] == target`**.
      - Move `r = mid - 1` to search in the left half for an earlier occurrence.
      - The last stored index is the first occurrence.

    - **Finding the last occurrence:**
      - Perform binary search and **store the index when `nums[mid] == target`**.
      - Move `l = mid + 1` to search in the right half for a later occurrence.
      - The last stored index is the last occurrence.

    **Time Complexity:** O(log n) for both searches â†’ **Total: O(log n)**.
    **Space Complexity:** O(1), as no extra space is used.
